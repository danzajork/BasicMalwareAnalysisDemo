* Description: This is a presentation that covers the basics of static and dynamic malware analysis.

## Why You Should Care
Malware analysis is an important skill to have when responding to a network incident.  When a malware incident occurs on a network we need to identify what happened to properly assess and contain the damage.  Questions will arise from what data may have been taken, what files were infected, and what machines are infected.  We need to understand what a binary can do to answer these questions.  Further more, the analysis will help define signatures allowing us to detect the malware infections on the network.

Malware analysis is generally categorized as static and dynamic.  Static analysis consists of analyzing a potentially malicious file without executing it.  Dynamic analysis consists of analyzing a potentially malicious file during and after execution.  Both static and dynamic analysis can be further categorized as basic and advanced.  Basic static analysis is the process of analyzing a file without looking at the actual instructions or code.  The goal of static analysis is understand if a binary is malicious, understand the functionality, and create signatures for detection.  Basic dynamic analysis involves running the malware and observing the behavior on the system.  The goal of dynamic analysis is to further understand its functionality to remove the infection from a system and create signatures for detection.

## Three Main Ideas
1. Basic static analysis is the process of analyzing a file without looking at the actual instructions or code. 
2. Basic dynamic analysis involves running the malware and observing the behavior on the system.
3. The goal of malware analysis is to answer questions as to what happened during a network incident and to create signatures to detect malware infections on the network.

## Future Direction
This topic can be further explored by researching advanced topics in malware analysis.  Advanced static analysis is the process of reverse-engineering the malware using a disassembler or decompiler and looking at the program instructions to discover what the malware does.  Advanced dynamic analysis consists of using a debugger to examine or manipulate the state of the executing binary.
